###About the project:

We created a tool that allows you to identify companies in news articles that are related to a topic. 

Execution process:

First you have to create a virtual enviroment in order to install the required libraries easier.
Here is a tutorial in how to do it https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

my_env\Scripts\activate

If necesary you can execute the next command to allow the activation of the venv in windows:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass  

Any new library necesary to execute this process goes in requiremets.txt
Then you install it using:
    
pip install -r requirements.txt
